# Expense Reimbursement System

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees 
for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and 
submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. 
Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for 
all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests 
for expense reimbursement.
